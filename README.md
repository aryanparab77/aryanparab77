Hi, I’m Aryan.

I’m a final year AI & Data Science student who enjoys working on problems that involve logic, data, and clean code.  
I like breaking problems down, understanding the core idea behind them, and building projects that are practical and easy to follow.

Right now, I’m focused on strengthening my fundamentals and improving how I write and structure code, rather than rushing into a single role.

Created dashboards using SQL and Power BI to analyze sales trends and KPIs.  
This project helped me understand how raw data can be converted into useful business insights.
